# Fat_Tails_Aiyagari
Replication of the Aiyagari Model with Fat-Tailed Distribution of Wealth by Achdou et. al. 2014

The orignal model and codes can be found in this links: [paper](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/HACT.pdf), [appendix](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/HACTproject/HACT_Numerical_Appendix.pdf) and [codes](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/HACTproject.htm)

You can find my description of the model and algorithm with non-uniform grid [here](https://github.com/clizama/Fat_Tails_Aiyagari/blob/master/Aiyagari%20Model%20with%20Fat-tailed%20Wealth%20Distribution.pdf)

In this repository you can find the codes in Julia to replicate the results of this paper.
